## Projects

- **[Prof. Robot: Differentiable Robot Rendering Without Static and Self-Collisions](https://www.qrcat.cn/prof-robot/)**
  - **2024/07 - 2024/11**
  - Researched collision issues in differentiable robot rendering, combining binary classification with SDF fields to achieve collision detection and elimination for robots
  - Used dependent multi-layer perceptrons to learn SDF fields from robot poses to determine collisions, improving gradient optimization reliability
  - Converted SDF fields to collision probabilities, using classification loss to eliminate need for exact manifold distance labels without explicit manifold distance calculations
